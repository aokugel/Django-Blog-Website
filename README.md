# My Django Blog

### Overview

This is my django code repository for anthonykugel.com.  The website is written using the django web framework.  Frontend assets are written in html, css, and javascript.  The website itself is running on AWS.  The web server is running on nginx on an ec2 instance, the database is on Postgresql running on AWS RDS.  I registered the domain using aws route 53.
